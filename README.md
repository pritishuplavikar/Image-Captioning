# Image-Captioning

Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) model is trained on the Flickr8k dataset to generate descriptions of images. Image features (extracted from a pretrained CNN - InceptionV3) and word embeddings were used to train the model. A WMD score of 0.78 was achieved on the test dataset. Keras machine elarning framework is used. Check eval.ipnyb to see more results.
